Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) , which is a family of cryptography [[hashing]] [[algorithm]] that are used to create digital signatures for data integrity verification. [[SHA]] [[algorithm]] is used to hash data and certificate files, and they produce a unique hash for each piece of the data.

Some examples of SHA algorithms include: 

- SHA-1
    
    Designed by the United States National Security Agency, this algorithm produces a 160-bit hash value. It's still widely used, even though it's been cryptographically broken. 
    
- SHA-256
    
    This algorithm was published in 2001 as a successor to the SHA-1 family. It was developed jointly by the NSA and NIST, and the final hash digest value is always 256 bits.
