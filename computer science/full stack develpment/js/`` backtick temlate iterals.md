It is introduced in [[Es6]]

we can define a [[string]] in 3 diffrent type.

1. ""
2. ''
3. ``

1.we can use a variable in backtick by using ${} inside the backtick which is known as [[interpolate]]
2.we can give multiline string using backtick
3.we can evalute a expression inside the ${}

eg: ${1+1} //which gives the output of 2 as a string
eg:

a = 10
b = 11
c = `${a}+${b}`   The backtick is invisible because  of Obsidian reserved character.
