It is main feature of [[Es6]] 

With array destructuring, you are free to give any variable name to the items that you destructure from an array.

eg: 

```js
const foo = ["one", "two", "three"];  
const [red, yellow, green] = foo;
console.log(red);
console.log(yellow);
console.log(green);
```

output:
```
one
two
three
```
