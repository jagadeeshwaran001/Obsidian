**[[js]] compiler**

Babel is a tool that allows developers to write JavaScript code using the latest features and syntax, and then run it in browsers that may not support those features. Babel translates modern JavaScript code into an older version that more browsers can understand. This is done to address the issue of backward compatibility in JavaScript.
