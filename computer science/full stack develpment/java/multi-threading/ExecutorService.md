You can also use [[java]] `ExecutorService` to manage [[thread]]s. This provides more control over [[thread]] creation and lifecycle.

##### Key features:
 - [[Thread Pooling]]
 - [[Task Submission]]
 - [[Graceful Shutdown]]

Types of [[ExecutorService]]:
- [[Fixed Thread Pool]]
- [[Cached Thread Pool]]
- [[Single-Threaded Executor]]
- [[Scheduled Thread Pool]]

### [[Shutting Down the ExecutorService]]

### Handling Results with [[Future]]

### [[Error Handling and Timeout in ExecutorService]]

### [[Scaling Thread Pool Based on the Task Load]]

This is the not dependent on the any external [[jar]], This is the default feature in [[java utils]].concurrent

- Step 1: Create a Service with `ExecutorService`
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

@Service
public class MyExecutorService {

    private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

    public void executeTask() {
        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Executor Service method execution: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            // Simulate a long task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

- Step 2: Use the [[ExecutorService]]
You can inject this service into your controller or other services and execute tasks.
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyExecutorService myExecutorService;

    @GetMapping("/executeTask")
    public String executeTask() {
        myExecutorService.executeTask();
        return "Task executed in ExecutorService!";
    }
}
```

### **Using `ExecutorService`**

#### Pros:

- **Full Control**: You have complete control over the thread pool size, task scheduling, and error handling. You can customize every aspect of multithreading.
- **Flexible Thread Management**: You can decide whether you want to create a fixed-size thread pool, cached thread pool, or a scheduled thread pool.
- **Widely Used**: It’s part of Java’s standard library (`java.util.concurrent`), so you’re not tied to Spring or any other framework.
- **Customizable Error Handling**: You can handle exceptions in threads and decide how to deal with them.

#### Cons:

- **Complexity**: It requires more setup and careful management of thread pools (e.g., you have to explicitly shut down `ExecutorService`).
- **Resource Management**: If not properly managed, it can lead to issues like thread leakage or resource exhaustion.
- **Manual Error Handling**: You need to handle the errors and exceptions occurring in threads manually, which requires extra coding effort.

#### Best Use Case:

- When you need full control over thread management, such as in complex scenarios where performance tuning, error handling, and task scheduling are critical.
