[[Runnable]] and [[Callable]] are two key [[interface]] in Java for representing tasks that can be executed [[asynchronous]]ly or in parallel. They are commonly used in [[computer science/Software Engineering/multi-threading|multi-threading]] environments, especially when working with [[ExecutorService]] and other concurrency mechanisms.


### **Differences Between `Runnable` and `Callable`**

| Feature            | `Runnable`                                              | `Callable`                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Method Signature   | `void run()`                                            | `V call() throws Exception`             |
| Return Value       | Cannot return a result                                  | Returns a result (of type `V`)          |
| Exception Handling | Cannot throw checked exceptions                         | Can throw checked exceptions            |
| Usual Use Case     | Suitable for tasks that don't need a result             | Suitable for tasks that return a result |
| How to Use         | Often used with `Thread` or `ExecutorService.execute()` | Used with `ExecutorService.submit()`    |
### **When to Use [[Runnable]] vs. [[Callable]]**

- **Use [[Runnable]]**: When you don’t need the task to return a result and don’t expect it to throw checked exceptions.
    
    - Example: Periodic logging, updating a user interface, background tasks that don’t need a result.
- **Use [[Callable]]**: When you need the task to return a result or may need to handle exceptions.
    
    - Example: Complex computations, data processing, tasks that may fail with exceptions like reading from a file or network.

### Conclusion

- **[[Runnable]]** is ideal for tasks that don’t require a return value or checked exceptions.
- **[[Callable]]** is a more powerful alternative when you need to return a value or handle exceptions.
- Both [[Runnable]] and [[Callable]] are frequently used with [[ExecutorService]] to run tasks [[asynchronous]]sly in Java.
