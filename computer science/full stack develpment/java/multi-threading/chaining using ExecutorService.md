### Steps for Chaining using `ExecutorService`:

1. Submit tasks to the `ExecutorService`.
2. Wait for the result of each task (using `Future.get()`), then pass that result to the next task.
3. Chain tasks by submitting the next task only after the previous one has finished.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ExecutorServiceChainingExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        try {
            // Task 1: Fetch user details
            Future<String> future1 = executorService.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Step 1: Fetching user details...");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate delay
                return "User: John";
            });

            // Task 2: Fetch user order (depends on Task 1's result)
            Future<String> future2 = executorService.submit(() -> {
                String user = future1.get();  // Wait for Task 1 to complete
                System.out.println("Step 2: Fetching order for " + user);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate delay
                return "Order: Laptop";
            });

            // Task 3: Send notification (depends on Task 2's result)
            Future<Void> future3 = executorService.submit(() -> {
                String order = future2.get();  // Wait for Task 2 to complete
                System.out.println("Step 3: Sending notification for " + order);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate delay
                return null;
            });

            // Waiting for the final task to complete
            future3.get();  // Wait for Task 3 to complete
            System.out.println("Step 4: Task Completed, cleaning up...");

        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```

##### output:

```
Step 1: Fetching user details...
Step 2: Fetching order for User: John
Step 3: Sending notification for Order: Laptop
Step 4: Task Completed, cleaning up...
```

### Pros and Cons of Using `ExecutorService` for Chaining

#### Pros:

1. **Full Control**: You have complete control over the execution of tasks and their dependencies.
2. **Flexibility**: Can manage custom thread pools, error handling, and resource management.
3. **Simple for Small Chains**: Easy to implement for small chains of tasks.

#### Cons:

1. **Manual Chaining**: You need to manually wait for each `Future` to complete (`future.get()`), making the code less readable and more prone to blocking if not handled carefully.
2. **Blocking**: Calls to `get()` are blocking, which means the current thread waits until the task is done. This can lead to performance issues in some scenarios.
3. **Complex for Larger Chains**: As the chain of tasks grows, the code becomes harder to manage compared to `CompletableFuture`'s fluent API.
