 [[java]] allows you to wrap the value of the primitive into a wrapper class [[Integer]]. This allows several methods for dealing with integers, such as converting from a string to a `double`, `comparisons`, `maximum` and `minimum` size and so on. The integer class is `immutable`, which makes it [[Thread-safe]]. The extra functionality and safety incur a memory cost, and [[Integer]] object will take 16 bytes of memory to store.
