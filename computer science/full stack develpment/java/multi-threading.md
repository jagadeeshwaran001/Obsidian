Types of [[computer science/full stack develpment/java/multi-threading|multi-threading]] in java and its difference.

- [[@Async]]
- [[ExecutorService]]
- [[CompletableFuture]]

|Feature|`@Async`|`ExecutorService`|`CompletableFuture`|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Ease of Use**|Easy to implement with minimal code|Requires more setup|Moderately easy, chaining adds complexity|
|**Control over Threads**|Low|High|Medium (with underlying `ExecutorService`)|
|**Error Handling**|Spring handles most of it|Manual|Supports exception handling in chaining|
|**Scalability**|Configurable but limited|Highly scalable|Good for asynchronous tasks with chaining|
|**Return Values**|Supports `Future`/`CompletableFuture`|Supports any return type|Designed for handling return values easily|
|**Integration**|Best for Spring Boot apps|Pure Java, no framework required|Works well with or without Spring|
|**Control over Task Flow**|Basic (start async method)|Full control (tasks, thread pool)|Great for combining/chaining tasks|
|**Error Handling**|Simple (Spring handles it)|Manual|Built-in handling through methods like `handle()`, `exceptionally()`|

### **Which is Best?**

- **For Simple Async Methods in a Spring Boot Application**: Use `@Async`. It is lightweight, easy to set up, and sufficient for most use cases where you need simple background processing.
    
- **For Complex, High-performance Applications**: Use `ExecutorService`. It offers complete control over threads, task management, and tuning for high-performance, large-scale systems.
    
- **For Composing or Chaining Asynchronous Tasks**: Use `CompletableFuture`. Itâ€™s ideal when you need to handle multiple asynchronous tasks and combine their results in a flexible, non-blocking way.
