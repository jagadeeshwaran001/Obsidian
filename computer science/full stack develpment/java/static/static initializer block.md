- [[static]] initializer block is used to initialize the static object in a class.
- This block is called then the class is loaded in to the memory, even before any object of the class is created, even before the main method(if exists).

```java
class MyClass {
    static {
        // Static initialization block
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }

    static int myStaticVariable;

    static {
        // Initialize static variable
        myStaticVariable = 10;
        System.out.println("Static variable initialized.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method executed.");
        System.out.println("myStaticVariable: " + myStaticVariable);
    }
}
```

#### output:
```
Static block executed.
Static variable initialized.
Main method executed.
myStaticVariable: 10
```
### Key Points:

- A class can have multiple `static` blocks, and they will be executed in the order they are defined.
- The `static` block is executed when the class is first loaded into memory, not when an instance is created.
- Useful for complex static variable initialization that can't be done in a single line.
- You can't use non-static fields or methods directly in a `static` block since `static` members belong to the class, not to instances of the class.
