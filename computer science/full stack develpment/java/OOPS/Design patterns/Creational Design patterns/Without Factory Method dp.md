Step 1: Define the Car Interface

```java
public interface Car {
    void drive();
}
```

Step 2: Implement Concrete Car Classes

```java
public class Sedan implements Car {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a Sedan.");
    }
}

public class SUV implements Car {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving an SUV.");
    }
}
```

Step 3: Implement the Client Code Directly

```java
public class CarClient {
    public void driveCar(String type) {
        Car car;

        // Direct instantiation based on the type
        if (type.equals("Sedan")) {
            car = new Sedan();
        } else if (type.equals("SUV")) {
            car = new SUV();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown car type");
        }

        car.drive();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarClient client = new CarClient();
        client.driveCar("Sedan");  // Directly creates a Sedan
        client.driveCar("SUV");    // Directly creates an SUV
    }
}
```

### **Problems with This Approach:**

1. **Tight Coupling:**
    
    - The `CarClient` class is tightly coupled to the concrete classes `Sedan` and `SUV`. It directly creates instances of these classes within its `driveCar` method. This means any change to the car types or their instantiation logic requires modifying the `CarClient` class.
2. **Lack of Extensibility:**
    
    - Adding a new car type (e.g., `Truck`) requires modifying the `CarClient` class to handle the new type. This violates the Open/Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. The `CarClient` must be changed every time a new car type is introduced.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle Violation:**
    
    - The `CarClient` class is responsible not only for using `Car` objects but also for creating them. This mixes the concerns of object creation and object usage, making the code harder to maintain and extend.
4. **Code Duplication Risk:**
    
    - If multiple parts of the application need to create cars in a similar way, the car creation logic will be duplicated across these parts, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistencies.
