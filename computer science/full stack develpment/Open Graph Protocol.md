OGP (2010) is a set of rules for the [[metadata]], that allows the pages to show the preview of the other pages before user click or any interactions.

The [[Open Graph Protocol]] used the same `<meta {attribute}>` tags but instead of the namn attribute we need to give the property attribute.

eg:
``` html
<meta property="og:title" content="My First Web page"/>
```

The property has several values such as
- title: defined the title of the page
- type: These is used to specify the type such as website, audio, image ...
- url: defines the permanent web address of the page we use in out page.
- image: defines the url of the image need to display.
- description: defined the description
- locale: defined the language
- site_name: defined the site name displayed in other sites.
