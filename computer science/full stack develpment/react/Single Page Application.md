A Single Page Application allows the user to interact with the website without downloading entire new webpages. Instead, it rewrites the current webpage as the user interacts with it. The outcome is that the application will feel faster and more responsive to the user.

[[React]] is a famous for creating single page application

There are two approaches to serving code and resources in Single Page Applications.

1. [[Bundling]]
2. [[code splitting]]


## An Example of a Single-Page App

Imagine there is a webpage that has a Label and a Button. It will display a random movie name when the button is clicked.

In a traditional website, when the button is clicked, the browser will send a POST request to the web server. The web server will return a new web page containing the button and movie name, and the web browser renders the new page.

In a Single Page Application, when the button is clicked, the browser will send a POST request to a web server. The web server will return a JSON object. The application reads the object and updates the Label with the movie name.

## Anchor Tag Elements in Single-Page Elements

A single-page application canâ€™t have regular anchor tag elements as a traditional web app can.

The reason for this is that the default behavior of an anchor tag is to load another HTML file from a server and refresh the page. This page refresh is not possible in a SPA that's powered by a library such as React because a total page refresh is not the way that a SPA works, as explained earlier in this lesson item.

Instead, a SPA comes with its own special implementation of anchor tags and links, which only give an illusion of loading different pages to the end user when in fact, they simply load different components into a single element of the real DOM into which the virtual DOM tree gets mounted and updated.

That's why navigation in a single-page app is fundamentally different from its counterpart in a multi-page app. Understanding the concepts outlined in this lesson item will make you a more well-rounded React developer.
