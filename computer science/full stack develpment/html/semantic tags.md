If we use [[semantic tags]] in our pages, it helps the [[search engine]] and accessibility software to understand the website.

Instead of using `<div>` or `<span>` for all the elements, we can specify the portion of the page using sematic tags.

such as `<body>` is for [[html]] body, `<nav>` is for navigation element.

`<article>` tag is for the article in the page. (The article element is used for complete, self-contained compositions on a web page.)

`<header>` is for the heading of the specific article

>`<head>` and `<header>` has different purpose.

`<main>` is for the main content of the article.

`<section>` is used to specify the individual section of the `<main>` or `<article>` tags.

>`<section>` doesn't require `<main>` or `<article>` tags.

`<footer>` is for the footer.

`<aside>` A secondary set of content that is not required to understand the main content.

`<details>` A collapsed section of content that can be expanded if the user wishes to view it.

`<summary>` Specifies the summary or caption of a `<details>` element.
