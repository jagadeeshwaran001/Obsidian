[[Tightly-coupled]] refers to a situation where components or classes are closely connected, and changes in one component often require changes in others. In the context of object creation, tight coupling occurs when the client code is directly responsible for creating instances of specific classes, making it difficult to modify or extend the system without affecting the client code.
