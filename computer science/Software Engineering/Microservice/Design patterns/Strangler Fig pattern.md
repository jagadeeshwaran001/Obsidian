[[Strangler fig]] pattern is  used to migrate form the [[monolith]] service to [[Microservice]] part-by-part like a [[Strangler fig]] slowly covering the host  tree and at the end it eventually kill the host. and became a full [[banyan]] tree.

Like wise we need to slowly convert our business logic into [[Microservice]] and eventually shout down the [[monolith]] architecture.

It is not recommended to convert the [[Microservice]] is a single shot ([[Big Bang]] migration).
