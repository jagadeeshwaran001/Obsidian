**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** is a [[AI]] framework that combines the information retrieval with [[LLM]]

## Why RAG matters?

- [[LLM]] are trained on the data up to the certain date.
- Not trained on our data
- [[AI hallucination]]
## What is RAG ?

- [[RAG]] combines the **retrieval based** methods and **Generative models** to produce more accuracy and contextual relavant output.
- Allow [[LLM]] to access external data source (Knowledge source), mitigating limitations like outdated information and knowledge cut-off.

## What is not a [[RAG]]

- Sending all the your documents in the context of each request.
- If you want to summarize the entire document this makes sense but is not [[RAG]]
- [[Context window limit]].
