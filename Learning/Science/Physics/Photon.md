Photon didn't have mass because it doesn't interact with [[Higgs fields]]
[[My Questions]] What is photon, it has [[Duel-Nature]] (wave and particle nature), how it gets that nature?

In particle form does that considered as a fundamental particle?

What is the relationship between [[Thermal Radiation]] and the photon?

How it emits the [[Electro-Magnetic Radiation]] and how it is perpendicular?

Why photon is not interacting with [[Dark Matter]]?

How it is constant?
