The story of "The Black Panther of Sivanipalli" is a real-life adventure narrative written by [[Kenneth Anderson]], a renowned big game hunter and author, detailing his pursuit of a rare black panther in the jungles of Tamil Nadu, India. The events are believed to have occurred between 1934 and 1935 near the village of Sivanipalli (also known as Shivanahalli), close to Denkanikotta in the Krishnagiri district. The black panther, a result of melanism in a leopard, was a rare and mysterious sight, which unnerved the superstitious villagers who initially dismissed reports of its sighting as a sign of Satan.
