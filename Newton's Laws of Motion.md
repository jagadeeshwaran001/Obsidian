- **First Law (Law of Inertia)**:
    
    - An object will remain at rest or move in a straight line at constant [[speed]] unless acted upon by a net external [[Force]].
    - **Example**: A book on a table will stay in place unless you push it.
- **Second Law**:
    
    - The [[acceleration]] of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its [[mass]]:
	    $F=ma$
    
    Where:
    
    - $F$ is the force,
    - $m$ is the mass of the object,
    - $a$ is the acceleration.
    - **Example**: A heavier object requires more force to accelerate than a lighter one.
- **Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**:
    
    - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
    - **Example**: When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with an equal force.
