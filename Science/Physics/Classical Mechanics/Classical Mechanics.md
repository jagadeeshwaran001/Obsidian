[[Classical Mechanics]] deals with the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of [[Force]]s and the laws governing that [[motion]]. It is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of [[physics]] and includes the study of:

- [[Force]]s: The interaction between objects that causes changes in their motion.
- [[Newton's Laws of Motion]]: The three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between forces and the motion of objects.
- [[Energy]] and [[Work]]: The concepts related to the ability of forces to do work, change the state of motion, and cause deformation.
- [[Momentum]]: The product of an object’s mass and velocity, describing the quantity of motion it possesses.
- [[Rotational Motion]] and [[Angular Momentum]]: The study of objects that are rotating or spinning, influenced by torques.
- [[Kinematics]]: The study of motion without considering its causes (force and energy).
- [[Dynamics]]: The study of the forces that cause motion and changes in motion.
- [[Gravitation]]: The study of the force of [[gravity]], which governs the motion of planets, stars, and objects on Earth.
### **Subfields of Classical Mechanics**:

- [[Statics]]: Study of forces on objects that are in equilibrium (at rest or moving with constant velocity).
- [[Kinetics]]: Study of motion under the influence of forces.
- [[Fluid Mechanics]]: Study of forces in fluids (liquids and gases).
### **Relevance of Topics Discussed**:

- **Forces** and **Newton’s Laws** are the foundational principles of classical mechanics.
- [[Centripetal force]] and [[Centrifugal Force]] relate to circular motion and are part of dynamics and rotational mechanics.
- **Momentum** and [[Angular Momentum]] are key concepts in the study of both linear and rotational motion.
- [[Gravitational Force]] and other forces (like [[Tension]] and [[Friction]]) are part of the study of forces acting on objects.
### Other Related Branches:

- [[Thermodynamics]]: In some cases, when forces relate to work and energy transfer, thermodynamics may intersect with mechanics.
- [[Electromagnetism]]: For the study of forces like electromagnetic force, it connects to a different branch of physics.
### Modern Extension:

Though [[Classical Mechanics]] deals with macroscopic objects and forces, it has limitations at extremely small scales (like in [[Quantum mechanics]]) or at very high speeds ([[relativity]]). Nonetheless, it remains fundamental in understanding everyday phenomena.
