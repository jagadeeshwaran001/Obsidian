**Force** is a fundamental concept in [[physics]] that describes any interaction that, when unopposed, can change the [[motion]] of an object. It can cause an object to accelerate, decelerate, remain in place, or change its direction. In simpler terms, a force is a push or a pull exerted on an object.

### **Key Characteristics of Force**:

1. **Magnitude**: The strength of the force, usually measured in **Newtons (N)** in the [[SI]] system.
2. **Direction**: Force has a specific direction, making it a [[vector quantity]]. The effect of a force depends on both its magnitude and the direction in which it is applied.
3. **Point of Application**: The specific point where the force is applied to an object.
4. **Type of Interaction**: Forces arise from interactions between objects, which can be contact forces (like [[Friction]]) or non-contact forces (like [[gravity]]).
### **Types of Forces**:

1. **Contact Forces**:
    
    - These forces occur when objects are in physical contact with each other.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Friction**: The force resisting the motion of an object in contact with a surface.
        - **Tension**: The force exerted through a string, rope, or wire when it is pulled tight.
        - **Normal Force**: The support force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the object.
        - **Air Resistance**: A type of [[Friction]]al force that opposes an object’s motion through the air.
2. **Non-contact Forces**:
    
    - Forces that act on objects without requiring physical contact.
    - **Examples**:
        - [[Gravitational Force]]: The attractive force between two masses (e.g., Earth's gravity pulling objects toward its center).
        - [[Electromagnetic Force]]: Forces between charged particles, including electric and magnetic forces.
        - [[Nuclear Forces]]: Forces acting within atomic [[nuclei]], such as the [[strong nuclear force]] holding [[Proton]] and [[Neutron]]s together.

### **Force Formula**:

As per Newton's Second Law, the general equation for force is:

- The [[acceleration]] of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its [[mass]]:
	    $F=ma$
    
    Where:
    
    - $F$ is the force,
    - $m$ is the mass of the object,
    - $a$ is the acceleration.
    - **Example**: A heavier object requires more force to accelerate than a lighter one.

### **Units of Force**:

- In the **SI system**, the unit of force is the **Newton (N)**. One Newton is defined as the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass by 1 m/s²: 
							$1 N=1 kg⋅1 m/s2$
- In the **[[CGS]] system**, the unit of force is the **dyne**, where 1 [[dyne]] = $10^{-5}$ Newtons.

### **Effects of Force**:

- **Change in Motion**: Force can cause objects to start moving, stop moving, or change direction.
- **Change in Shape**: Force can also deform objects, like squeezing a rubber ball.
- **Equilibrium**: If the net force on an object is zero (balanced forces), the object will either remain at rest or move with constant velocity.

### **Examples of Force in Everyday Life**:

1. **Gravity**: Gravity pulls objects toward the Earth, making things fall.
2. **Pushing a Cart**: When you push a shopping cart, you apply a force that accelerates the cart forward.
3. **[[Friction]]**: When you slide an object across a surface, [[Friction]] opposes the motion.
