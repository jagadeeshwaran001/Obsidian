Light is the fastest thing in the universe, and any object with mass can't surpass the speed of light as per [[Mass invariance]] by [[Einstain]], if so then how quantum entanglement happens?

My thoughts,
- May be the information is passed by the some phenomena which doesn't has [[Mass]], so it doesn't break einstein theory.If so even light has no mass then why it limit with the [[c]]?
knows energy interact with higa field so it is only one possible way that the un-known energy (may be [[Dark Energy]]) is acting.
If so we need to think that why ot only happend in [[quantum]] world not in [[classical]] world?
