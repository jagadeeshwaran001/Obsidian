[[My Questions]] If the universe is expanding then masses in the [[space-time]] will slowly losses its gravity, because think if a bread has nuts in it before baked. While baking the bread in the oven the bread will expand like a [[space-time]] and the nuts remains the same mass as it is, but the pressure on the nuts before baked and after baked will reduce, because of the expansion.

If so, i need to find the rate of gravity loss constant with respect to universe expansion rate constants.

or else, There should be another un-known phenomenon(as per my knowledge) is acting in this universe to maintain the gravity (pressure in the bread nuts scenario). I should search for the proof for the phenomenon.

The answers:

Scientist has a [[hypothesis]] that the universe is expanding because of the [[Dark Energy]]
