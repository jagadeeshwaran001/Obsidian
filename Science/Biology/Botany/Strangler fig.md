**Strangler figs** (a group of [[Fig]] species) start life as seeds germinating on another tree. The seedling sends roots down the host’s trunk to reach the ground. Over time, the fig’s roots thicken, surround the host tree, and can eventually kill it by blocking light or crushing it.

This is not a part of [[Parasite plants]]

**Fig trees** grow independently. They make their own food through photosynthesis and take water and nutrients from the soil, not from another plant.
