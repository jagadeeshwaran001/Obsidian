HeLa cells are an [[immortalized human cell]] line derived from [[cervical cancer]] cells taken from [[Henrietta Lacks]] in [[1951]].

They are the oldest and one of the most commonly used human cell lines in scientific research, known for their remarkable durability and ability to proliferate indefinitely in laboratory culture, unlike most human cells which eventually enter senescence

This immortality is due to the cells' active [[telomerase]], which prevents telomere shortening, allowing them to bypass the [[Hayflick limit]] on [[cell divisions]]

HeLa cells have been instrumental in numerous scientific breakthroughs, including the development of the [[polio vaccine]], research on [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], viral infections like [[HIV]] and [[Zika]], [[COVID Vaccine]], [[gene mapping]], and [[drug testing]].

Despite their immense scientific value, their origin without Lacks's knowledge or consent has raised significant ethical concerns regarding informed consent and the commercialization of human biological materials.
