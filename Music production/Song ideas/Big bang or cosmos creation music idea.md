After the very first instance of the time after the big bang due to heavy energy interaction the energy is transformed into mass as per string theory and the masses index must be unimaginable high which makes highly disorted traverse waves, to depic this we need to compose a high metallic or bass string session. At some point due to universe expansion the atmosphere index became lighter gradually. The universe expansion is depicted as the turning point of the disorted string and then music get gentle(mostly flute or wind instruments with primitive percussion). and finally mix all the bass disorted string wind instruments and percussion which represents the cosmos monology (The universe are getting attracted each other and became one big black hole of emptyness)
